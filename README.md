# POuL_Badge
Preliminar work for a ESP-32 based badge for the POuL association (https://www.poul.org/ our website)

This is a ESP32 based board, the code will be written using the ESP-IDF schematics and it will also be released under GNU3 License.

### Why we made this board
The general idea behind this board is to learn with some members of the association how to write effective low level code, how to use Ki-cad to design the board and how to solder SMD components.

### What should it be able to do
It should be able to connect to other identical badges and play some 1vs1 game using bluetooth to stream real time data from the two players; Aditionally it will be possible to add more game, directly adding them into the SD card and tweak a few things into the main of the ESP.

### What really is able to do
For now it only exist in our hope and dreams, and two or three components are connected on a Ki-cad project, but nothing usable.
